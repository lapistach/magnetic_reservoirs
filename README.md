Do a prediction based on sequence and not datapoints : use offsetter in hf
Do an optuna of both prediction per datapoint and prediction with sequences.

Write this read me and some more/less comments and pdf latex with bz loop, resistance comparison, choice, what to choose. --> done here

Then export every result and code on personal computer, create packages and break down the main, comment a little better (or not depending on how I did it the day before), put on private github (all friday if possible)

Should I actually upload the super_fast one ?
